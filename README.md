# Pairs-Trading-Algorithm
**Introduction**
This is a basic program made by me in Python which attempts to identify stock pairs on the US stock market which have a high correlation and are cointegrated with each other. The purpose of this program is to then make trading decisions based on the strategy of mean reversion: where by we attempt to profit off the movement of the cointegrated stocks towards the mean of the spread.
